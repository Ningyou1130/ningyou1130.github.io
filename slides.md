# HTML, CSS, jQuery Wokshop

---

## Step 0
- Download git and your choice static site server
or
- Download the repository zip, extract it, and use Dreamweaver
or
- Use GH: fork the repository and edit all code in the online interface
then:
- Create a Github account, and create a repository with yourusername.github.io

Note: GitHub is a version control cloud; think Google Drive or Dopbox, but for code. Github will host all your files for your site, and will allow it to be accessed as a normal website via a url. If you don't know how to use it, don't worry about that now. If you fork the presentation repo into your own with your unique username, you will be able to edit the files, upload, etc. right from the web interface, all for free.
