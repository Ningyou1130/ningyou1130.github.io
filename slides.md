Note: Use this repository as a reference. You can follow along with the slides and notes in `slides.md`, access all links, and view the source, including the static assets.

## Step 0
- Download git and your choice static site server
or
- Download the repository zip, extract it, and use Dreamweaver
or
- Use GH:
- Create a GH account and edit all code in the [online interface](https://github.com/) or download the [native GH desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/)
then:
- Fork this repository, or create a repository, both preferably named: `yourusername.github.io`

Note: GitHub is a version control cloud; think Google Drive or Dopbox, but for code. Github will host all your files for your site, and will allow it to be accessed as a normal website via a url. If you don't know how to use it, don't worry about that now. If you fork the presentation repo into your own with your unique username, you will be able to edit the files, upload, etc. right from the web interface, all for free. If you're not familiar with git or the commandline, you should use the online interface or desktop client. That naming convention will ensure your site is your personal page, but you can also access your site as a project page with an arbitrary name.

## Deploying to GitHub
- Create a branch called `gh-pages`
- Ensure that branch is up to date with your working branch.
- You can visit your site at `username.github.io` or `username.github.io/projectname` for projects

Note: This may be done on the online interface or from the commandline. That `gh-pages` name is important and that branch should not be deleted! It sometimes takes a few minutes for changes to propogate.
