# html-css-jquery-workshop

Building a basic static resume with HTML, CSS, and jQuery, and deploying to GitHub static pages.

//TODO:
Fill out dummy resume for Rubber the Duck (skills: html/css)
Simply style and incorporate Bootstrap (CDN before style)
Incoporate jQuery (CSN before script); create moving background color? (etc)
Add instructions for GH deployment (fork repo, edit and push, publish to branches page, visit via username)
